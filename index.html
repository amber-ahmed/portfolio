                        Hi, I am Amber Ahmed. I am 22 years old guy.I am a full stack web developer utilizing MERN stack
                        technology.I live in Hyderabad, India. I was born and raised
                        in Hyderabad, India. I completed my high school(8th-10th) at Central Public High School,
                        Hyderabad. I am interested in new technologies, modernization, and solving problems using
                        technologies. The world was being modernized by software technologies, Software was becoming the
                        solution to everything, these things got me interested in software So I thought of becoming a
                        software engineer. So, After High school, I completed 3 years of diploma in CME(Computer
                        Engineering) from Quli Qutub Shah Polytechnic College and took admitted to Deccan College of
                        Engineering and Technology for graduating  B.E(Bachelor of Engineering) with CSE(Computer
                        Science Engineering) stream. I am in 4th of 4 years of B.E. It is the last year of my
                        graduation.I learnt full stack web development from CFI(Code for India Foundation).

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I got admitted to a diploma program, I had no prior knowledge of the software
                    field. Unfortunately, the teachers and lecturers lacked the necessary skills and were not very
                    friendly or supportive, making it challenging for me to seek guidance. While I excelled in subjects
                    like math, physics, chemistry, and drawing, I struggled with core subjects like C, C++, and Data
                    Structures, as they were entirely new to me.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During this time, I acquired my first computer with specifications including a
                    Core Duo CPU, 500GB HDD, 2GB RAM, and Wi-Fi. Motivated to learn, I began searching for resources
                    online and started learning C programming through YouTube. However, due to academic commitments and
                    limited exposure, it took me longer to grasp the fundamentals of the C language. Nonetheless, I
                    managed to complete the basics and even developed my first project, a console GUI tic-tac-toe game
                    in C.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I also gained some familiarity with C++ along the way. My knowledge of programming
                    surpassed even that of the top students in my class, as the Indian education system tends to
                    prioritize grades and marks over practical skills. In my second year, I encountered a subject called
                    mobile application development, which was my first real exposure to how programming could be used in
                    real-life applications. We used Java and Android Studio for mobile development.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To accommodate the resource-intensive nature of Android Studio, I upgraded my
                    computer's RAM to 4GB. Despite the limitations, I delved into Android development and blindly
                    started coding a tic-tac-toe game for the Android platform. Eventually, I managed to complete it.
                    During this period, I also developed a simple application called "Secret Notes," which allowed users
                    to store text with a password, essentially functioning as a notepad.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Regrettably, I made the mistake of assuming my basic knowledge was sufficient at
                    the time and postponed further learning to my college years. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic
                    struck, and I wasted two years during the subsequent lockdown. On the academic front, I completed my
                    diploma, which granted me direct admission to the second year of a B.E. program.<br><br>


                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second year and half of the third year were spent in lockdown, where the
                    teachers and lecturers continued to lack sufficient expertise. They taught software engineering in a
                    traditional manner, often relying on blackboards. Additionally, the engineering college still
                    employed outdated software such as Windows 7 in 2021. During this period, I made the mistake of
                    starting to learn new languages or subjects as they arose, only to abandon them once they were
                    covered in the curriculum. Consequently, my understanding of various languages and subjects remained
                    incomplete.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, during the third year, we were assigned a mini project. While most of my
                    colleagues resorted to purchasing, borrowing, or copying projects from the internet, I preferred not
                    to engage in such practices. Instead, I decided to extend my "Secret Notes" application, investing
                    four months in coding. Through this project, named "Flashcard," I obtained a deep understanding of
                    Java concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, packages, and interfaces. While I had become
                    quite proficient with Android Studio, I still did not consider myself a full-fledged Android
                    developer, as I had not explored more advanced features like APIs or camera integration.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Feeling a sense of achievement, I uploaded "Flashcard" to the Google Play Store,
                    integrating advertisements to potentially earn money. However, given the number of existing
                    competitors and the lack of visibility for my application in search results, my excitement waned,
                    and I abandoned the project as it stood. It was then that I realized the flaws in my journey and
                    approach. Merely creating such applications would not guarantee employment opportunities, and I
                    needed to choose a specific technology or language to focus on. Unfortunately, I lacked proper
                    guidance or a roadmap.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To rectify this, I began researching different technologies and their applications
                    in the tech industry. I discovered various fields, such as web development, mobile development,
                    desktop development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and data science. Web
                    development caught my interest due to its high demand in the market, the widespread use of web
                    browsers, and the shift towards web-based business management instead of desktop applications.
                    Furthermore, web development appeared comparatively easier to learn and offered promising career
                    prospects. Additionally, my inclination toward building integrated applications aligned well with
                    this field.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With a resolute decision, I embarked on the path of learning full-stack web
                    development. I followed roadmaps provided by different websites, completing HTML and CSS before
                    commencing JavaScript. As the end of my third year approached, I temporarily paused my learning
                    journey to focus on exam preparations. It became evident that I couldn't undertake this journey
                    alone and needed to enroll in an online or offline web development course. Thus, I began my search
                    for coaching options.<br><br>


                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During this search, I stumbled upon an article on my Google news feed about the
                    "Code for India Foundation" (CFI), an organization offering courses in data analysis and full-stack
                    web development. Impressed by their genuine promises of placement guidance, excellent
                    infrastructure, and a clear syllabus, I decided to visit their website and meet with them. Moreover,
                    the foundation was affiliated with the reputable boot camp known as the Hacking School. After
                    successfully passing the entrance test, I secured admission to CFI.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since the previous batch had not yet completed, I had to wait for my own batch to
                    commence. In the meantime, my fourth year of college began. When my full-stack web development batch
                    finally started at CFI, I joined enthusiastically. It has been approximately one month since I
                    joined, and I have gained a wealth of knowledge. I have learned about topics such as number systems,
                    Linux commands, Git, and GitHub. I actively share my progress on LinkedIn, updating my network on
                    what I have learned.<br><br>

                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now, as a full-stack web developer, I reflect upon my journey so far, realizing
                    the mistakes I made and the need for proper guidance. It is clear that the path I was previously on
                    would not lead me to success. The software industry demands specialization, and with numerous
                    languages and technologies available, a focused approach is essential. I am determined to continue
                    my learning journey in full-stack web development, and I am grateful for the opportunity provided by
                    CFI.<br><br>
